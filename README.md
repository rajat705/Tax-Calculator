    - Overall income (after deductions) under 8 (≤) Lakhs is not taxed.
        - Ex - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  6 Lakhs, no tax
        - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  9 Lakhs, tax

        - 40% for people with age ≥ 40 but < 60
        - 10% for people with age ≥ 60
- Clicking on submit should show a modal which would show the final values based on above calculations.
